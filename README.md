# Boipoka
Introduction
This is an ECommerce Website in PHP project for Book Stores that I called Boipoka. This project provides the book store's client or possible client 
to have an online platform for exploring and order the different kinds of books that the store/shop is selling. 
The system has also an Admin Panel where the store management can manage the products, orders, and other data in the system.
